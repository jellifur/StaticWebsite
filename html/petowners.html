                        <h4>BACKGROUND</h4>
                        Pets improve their owners’ quality of life, but they become increasingly hard to care for 
                        as owners face increasing physical infirmity and/or economic pressures associated with age. 
                        Senior pet owners challenged by physical circumstances, time, or finances may not be able 
                        to adequately address their animals’ needs and welfare. We will explore the extent to which 
                        pet owners need assistance caring or providing for their pets.

                            We visited several retirement communities in order to directly observe the surroundings of our target users. 
                            These tours allowed us to assess the user group’s living situation and constraints, as well as to interview 
                            the tour guide.

                        A non-profit pet care service for people ages 60 and up. Seniors are paired with volunteers, 
                        who would help with their pet needs for a small administrative fee. Volunteers are carefully vetted before 
                        they are allowed to be in the program.
