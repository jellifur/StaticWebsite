            <h4>BACKGROUND</h4>
            Pets improve their owners’ quality of life, but they become increasingly hard to care for 
            as owners face increasing physical infirmity and/or economic pressures associated with age. 
            Senior pet owners challenged by physical circumstances, time, or finances may not be able 
            to adequately address their animals’ needs and welfare. We will explore the extent to which 
            pet owners need assistance caring or providing for their pets.

            <h4>USER RESEARCH</h4>
            <h4 class="user-research">Surveys</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Survey #1: Directed at pet owners. Distrbuted paper surveys to members of senior communities, and 
                    online surveys for senior pet-owners or people who can aid the less technically savvy seniors in 
                    their families.
                </li>
                <li>Survey #2: Directed at friends and families of senior pet-owners.
                </li>
            </ul>
                    
            <h4 class="user-research">Interviews</h4>
            In addition to our target users, we also interiewed stakeholders from a local retirement community:
            <ul>
                <li>Assisted Living Activities Director</li>
                <li>Skilled Nursing Activities Director</li>
                <li>Director of Resident Services</li>
                <li>Marketing Director</li>
            </ul>
            <h4 class="user-research">Guided Tours</h4>
            We visited several retirement communities in order to directly observe the surroundings of our target users. 
            These tours allowed us to assess the user group’s living situation and constraints, as well as to interview 
            the tour guide.
