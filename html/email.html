                        <ul>
                            <li>Learn which mobile phone email apps students use the most, 
                                and what influences their decisions to select those apps.</li>
                            <li>Learn how students currently communicate and collaborate with 
                                their peers using their phones.</li>
                            <li>Learn how students use Outlook on their phones through the usability study.</li>

                        <h4>ONLINE SURVEY</h4>
                        The online survey was completed prior to the usability study to provide us with 
                        insights into how students use emails, and other communication and collaboration software. 
                        It contained open and closed questions to provide qualitative and quantitative data. 
                        In order to collect data on the motivations behind mobile phone use, 
                        the survey contained questions about both mobile phone and laptop/desktop use.

                    We performed our usability test on the Microsoft Outlook mobile application.

                    <section>
                        <h4>WORKFLOW</h4>
                        We created a workflow diagram to map out functionalities of Outlook, which would help us 
                        design our usability tasks.

                        <ul>
                            <li>Full­time undergraduate students.</li>

                            <li>Smartphone owners (iOS or Android), who can bring their own phones to use in the study.</li>
                            <li>Available to participate on the day of the study.</li>
                            <li>Download Outlook and sign up before arriving to the study.</li>

                        <p>Each member of the team rotated roles between moderator and note taker. We had 8 target users, 
                        and ran sessions concurrently by splitting the team into two. This was done because of the limited 
                        time available in the usability lab. </p>
