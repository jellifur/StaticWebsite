                        <h4>BACKGROUND</h4>
                        At the beginning of the project, we thought about our own difficulties 
                        in choosing a college. We had to consider available financing, 
                        institutional reputation, distance to home, extracurriculars, choice of programs 
                        and majors, etc. We wondered whether data, rather than just our parents and 
                        guidance counselors, could have made this process easier.

                    <section>
                        <h4>INITIAL DESIGN QUESTION</h4>
                        How might we help high school and undergraduate college students make decisions 
                        for their post-secondary education?
                    </section>

                    <section>
                        <h4>TARGET USERS</h4>
                        High school seniors in the U.S. education system
                    </section>

                    <section>
                        <h4>COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The College Board</li>
                            <li>Chegg</li>
                            <li>Khan Academy</li>
                            <li>University websites (e.g. admissions.rpi.edu)</li>
                        </ul>
                        These organizations offer students various resources for researching potential schools. 
                        While the College Board and Khan Academy offer students advice on how to succeed, 
                        they do so with articles rather than interactive tools or visualizations. 
                        The first iteration of our project aimed to fill this gap by providing students 
                        with an interactive visualization of the data they need to make informed decisions.

                        <h4>DATA SET</h4>
                        We found data sets from the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), which 
                        is a federally funded organization that collects and analyzes data related to 
                        education in the United States. We initially decided to use the NCES Study of 1988, 
                        a longitudinal study of about 17,000 eighth grade students over the course of more 
                        than a decade.

                    <section>
                        <h4>INTERVIEWS &amp; PERSONAS</h4>
                        We interviewed 7 students and developed 2 personas based on these individuals. 
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <span style="font-weight:400;">Dustin</span> - Has a difficulty choosing a 
                                major based on his interest in journalism or a major in engineering based 
                                on job security.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <span style="font-weight:400;">Rebecca</span> - Wants to find an academic  
                                path that would best meet her interest in genetics, philanthropy, and making
                                a positive impact on humanity.
                            </li>

                        <h4>SKETCHES &amp; USER FEEDBACK</h4>
                        <figure>

                        </figure>
                        Feedback on the sketches, and further probing revealed that students&#39; main concern 
                        regarding postgraduate decision making was whether or not they would get a job. There 
                        was also a lack of interest in data visualizations. Therefore, we pivoted our design 
                        question and target users.

                        <h4>INTERVIEWS &amp; PERSONAS</h4>
                        We interviewed 4 and developed 3 personas based on these individuals. 
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <span style="font-weight:400;">Jackie</span> - Wants to recruit more low income 
                                and first generation students.
                            </li>

                        </ul>
                        Due to the limitation of our data set, we can only focus on users like Jackie.

                        <h4>UPDATING THE DATA SET</h4>
                        We updated our data set to the more recent one, which contains 23,000 ninth graders from 944 
                        schools starting from 2009. We extracted 30 variables from the study for our graphs.

                    <section>
                        <h4>USABILITY TEST</h4>
                        <p>We mocked up our sketches in Tableau, and conducted usability tests with college admissions 
                        counselors to identify areas for improvement. We prepared a script, list of tasks, and a 
                        brief survey for participants to complete after the test.</p>
                        
                        <p>As a result from the test, we made improvements on several confusing graph axes, titles, 
                        and legend labels. The color scheme also confused users in several graphs, so this was also 
                        updated to avoid misrepresenting different data as being alike. These changes helped improve 
                        our content clarity, consistency, and style.</p>

                        <p>Unfortunately, the biggest piece of feedback was something we were unable to fix, due to 
                        resources and time constraint. The content of the data presented was too general for our users. 
                        They have other paid tools and resources that would allow them to look up detailed personal 
                        information about students (e.g., standardized test scores, email addresses, etc.). The publicly 
                        available NCES data set we were using does not provide personally identifiable data, and we do 
                        not have the resources to compete with these other tools.</p>

                                the graphs. Hovering over the data points of the graphs delivers details-on-demand information 
                                about family income, percentage of students and demographic attributes.
