                    <section>
                        <h4>BACKGROUND</h4>
                        At the inception of the project, we reflected upon our own difficulties 
                        in choosing post-secondary education. We had to consider available financing, 
                        institutional reputation, distance to home, extracurriculars, choice of programs 
                        and majors, etc. We wondered whether data, rather than just our parents and 
                        guidance counselors, could have made this process easier.

                    <section>
                        <h4>INITIAL DESIGN QUESTION</h4>
                        How might we help high school and undergraduate college students make decisions 
                        for their post-secondary education?
                    </section>

                    <section>
                        <h4>TARGET USERS</h4>
                        High school seniors in the U.S. education system
                    </section>

                    <section>
                        <h4>COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The College Board</li>
                            <li>Chegg</li>
                            <li>Khan Academy</li>
                            <li>University websites (e.g. admissions.rpi.edu)</li>
                        </ul>
                        In summary, these companies and nonprofit organizations offer students articles, 
                        quizzes and tools to find, compare, and apply to schools, and pay for tuition. 
                        While the College Board and Khan Academy offer students advice on how to succeed, 
                        they do so with articles rather than interactive tools or visualizations for 
                        students to make their own decisions. In response to these other tools, 
                        the first iteration of our project aimed to fill a gap by providing students 
                        the data to make informed decisions through an interactive visualization.

                        <h4>DATA SET</h4>
                        We found data sets from the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), which 
                        is a federally funded organization that collects and analyzes data related to 
                        education in the United States. We initially decided to use the NCES Study of 1988, 
                        a longitudinal study of about 17,000 eighth grade students over the course of more 
                        than a decade.

                        <h4>INTERVIEWS &amp; PERSONAS</h4>
                        We interviewed 7 students and developed 2 personas based on these individuals. 
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <span style="font-weight:400;">Dustin</span> - Has a difficulty choosing a 
                                major based on his interest in journalism or a major in engineering based 
                                on job security?
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <span style="font-weight:400;">Rebecca</span> - Wants to find an academic  
                                path that would best meet her interest in genetics, philanthropy, and making
                                a positive impact on humanity?
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                    <section>
                        <h4>SKETCHES &amp; USER FEEDBACK</h4>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/datavis/sketch0.jpg" alt="Sketch" width="200">
                            <img src="../assets/datavis/sketch1.png" alt="Sketch" width="290">
                        </figure>
                        Feedback on the sketches, and further probing revealed that students&#39; main concern 
                        regarding postgraduate decision making was whether or not they would get a job. There 
                        was also a lack of interest in data visualizations. Therefore, we pivoted our design 
                        question and target users.
